              <li>Meet your local farmers and artisans! Check out farmers markets, farm stands, craft fairs, and local health stores that showcase local products!</li>
              <li>Ask good questions. Wondering about growing practices? Just ask! Questions like "Do you use pesticides?" "What do you feed your animals?" “What ingredients do you use?” Most craftsmen and farmers love talking about what they do!</li>
              <li>Trust your senses. Fresh produce should look vibrant and smell like, well, actual food. Wilted, slimy, or funky-smelling stuff is a no-go, whether it's from a farm or a grocery store.</li>
              <li>Look for the details. Good vendors can tell you where and how their food was grown and where materials come from. If someone gets dodgy about basic questions or can't tell you anything about their practices, that's a red flag.</li>
              <li>Certifications are cool but not required. Organic certification costs big bucks that many small farmers can't afford. Some use organic methods without the official label—this is where asking questions matters more than looking for stickers.</li>
              <li>Bring cash when possible. Card readers cost vendors fees, ask if there’s a payment method they prefer. If you have your own products, maybe you can even trade and barter!</li>
              <li>Imperfect is perfect. That wonky carrot tastes just as sweet as the supermarket's uniform ones. Small farms don't have industrial sorting machines, and that's a good thing!</li>
              <li>Seasonal variety is the spice of life. You'll get strawberries in June, not January. Eating seasonally is healthier, tastier, and better for the planet anyway.</li>
              <li>Prices reflect real costs. Small-scale farming is labor-intensive. You're paying for quality, care, and someone's livelihood—not corporate markups and shipping costs.</li>
              <li>Build relationships. Regular customers often get first dibs on popular items, helpful cooking tips, and sometimes extra goodies thrown in. Being friendly pays.</li>
              <li>Check local regulations. Most regions require food vendors to follow health codes. If you're buying meat, dairy, or eggs, verify they're following local safety rules.</li>
