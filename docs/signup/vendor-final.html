              <li>Presentation matters. Write an inviting bio and tell your story. Take clear photos and videos. Keep info updated and current.</li>
              <li>Your page is your digital market stand—make it inviting!</li>
              <li>Label everything clearly. Detailed product descriptions with pricing, weight/quantity, growing methods, ingredients and material sources. If perishable, put a Best By date.</li>
              <li>Keep your schedule consistent and visible. Post your market days, pickup windows, and online ordering deadlines everywhere. Customers need to know when and how to buy from you.</li>
              <li>Update your availability in real-time. Sold out of zucchini by 10am? Make sure your product's quantity is up to date. Nothing frustrates customers more than ordering something that's already gone.</li>
              <li>Be responsive. Check your orders and messages often if possible. Customers asking "Do you have any lavender soap?" need answers before they move on.</li>
              <li>Share your story. People love knowing where their food and crafts come from. Mix up your content: farm/craft photos, how to or how it’s made videos, growing updates, harvest highlights. Show the work and the passion, but keep posts scannable.</li>
              <li>Set communication boundaries. Post your response hours: "I check messages morning and evening, expect replies within 24 hours." Prevents burnout and sets realistic expectations.</li>
              <li>Be crystal clear about pickup procedures. Exact location, parking instructions, what to bring, how orders are labeled. "Pick up at the red barn, look for the cooler with orders alphabetized by last name."</li>
              <li>Digital payments made easy. Local Market lets you customize how you get paid. Use Plaid, Stripe, Venmo, PayPal, Zelle, Square—offer what your customers actually use. Yes there are fees, but convenience = sales.</li>
              <li>Time-stamp perishables. "Harvested Friday morning, pick up Saturday" gives customers confidence about freshness.</li>
              <li>Follow regulations. Know your local laws about selling certain products and across county/state lines.</li>
              <li>Manage complaints professionally. Bad produce in an online order? Respond quickly, apologize sincerely, offer refund/replacement. Handle privately before it becomes a public review.</li>
              <li>You set your own refund procedures. Make sure to be fair, if you need, we can help set you up with services to help handle refunds.</li>
              <li>Check out our built in Accounting system. We can help keep you organized by integrating your sales and expenses into our built-in accounting feature.</li>
              <li>Watch for scams. Fake payment confirmations, phishing attempts, too-good-to-be-true bulk orders. Trust your gut and verify payments before fulfilling orders.</li>
              <li>Upload any certificates, so you can show off your hard work. It's not necessary but will help boost your credibility.</li>
